I build software that connects data, systems, and real-world decision making.

As a Software Engineer at the University of Florida working with FDOT, I develop full-stack platforms for geospatial analytics, crash mapping, and data management workflows used by transportation professionals. My interests lie in scalable backend systems, clean architecture, and designing tools that balance performance, usability, and maintainability.

I’m driven by solving complex engineering problems and continuously improving how systems are designed and experienced.
